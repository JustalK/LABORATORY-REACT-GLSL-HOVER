# REACT APP TEMPLATE

## Goal

This project is a template for building React App linked to WebGl with all my favorite tools already configured.

Obviously, the app is using the latest version of `react`. For avoiding the relative path, I modified the webpack and allowing the import with an alias. I also added the support for sass files.

In addition, I added `prettier` and configured it for working well with `esLint`. Finally, I added the basic usefull package such as the router and the helmet.  

For the WebGl part, I am using `React Three Fiber` and `GLSL` for the shader. For a starting point, the project already has 2 pages with few meshes, 1 GLSL transition and a scroll linked to the canvas.

## Plan of the presentation

I explain with all the details how I build the project and my way of working.

## Documentation
#### Code documentation

The jsdoc can be generated locally with the following command :

```
npm run build:docs
```

## Development

#### Creating a page

For creating a new page, you need to set create a components inside the folder *pages* and to connect it in *app* by creating a Panel with the size of the page and creating the route.
